## Project Overview

This Contionous Assessment 2 is the continuation of my Advanced JavaScript assignment to display a Front End which fetched from a REST API. I have chose to do a Youtube Video API as it allows for the expandability and the complexity of relationships and functionalities of this case study.

In order to utilise my API to its utmost capacibilities. I have documented the basics API calls using [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) and examples of the resulting data you could expect when fetching through my API.

These endpoints are then being displayed on [my second CA](https://aj-ca2.vercel.app/) which uses React Native and Expo and a compiler to web.
